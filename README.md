# spatiotemporal-capstone
Sustainability Analysis of Lane county, Oregon. 
This project was completed in collaboration with Bailey Jones as our capstone project for Texas A&M University.

Read the final [paper](https://github.com/MadysonBradford/spatiotemporal-capstone/blob/main/Jones-Bradford-476-FinalPaper.pdf) to get a better idea of the math behind each calculation and the different assumptions this project was built on (there are many).

I'm adding a way to insert your own values into a csv and run that through the same analysis (since I used my own values for the sensitivity analysis, just hard-coded in).
